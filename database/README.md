# Helpclub Oracle Database

This module captures schema definition and seed data used by the platform.

## Contents

- `schema/` – DDL files for tables, packages, indexes
- `seeds/` – deterministic seed data for local development

Use Flyway or Liquibase through the Spring Boot service for automated migrations, or apply SQL files manually for DBA-managed environments.
